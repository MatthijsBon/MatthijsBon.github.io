1. Geomatics synthesis project
During the fourth quarter of the first year of the MSc Programme Geomatics for the Built Environment at the Delft University of Technology, the Geomatics Synthesis Project takes place. In this project students apply all their knowledge they have acquired during the courses while working in groups of five or six. In the prcess they gain experience in project management, data processing, data analysis, application and presentation. The overreaching topic was Monitoring flows and occupation patterns with Wi-Fi. In the scope of this topic, the project team AtoB focused on Identifying movement patterns from large scale Wi-Fi-based location data, both outdoor and indoor. While working on this project, I discovered I work well in groups and I like being up-to-date on every part of the project. I can switch easily from one job to another and like to help others in fixing their problems. Additionally, I found out that I like to have great visuals and I can be really critical on the right type of visualization.

2. Data visualization
For the data visualization course at the TU Delft, two teammembers and I created a data visualization of all municipalities in the Netherlands with data from the dutch cadastre and bureau of statistics (Kadaster & CBS). I really enjoyed this project, since it showed me the capabilities of D3.js and got me into javascript programming. Although I'm still not a hardcore javascript programmer, I enjoy looking for solutions in coding and javascript offers many solutions to a problem. Additionally, I was mainly responsible for the data. Manipulating and transforming the data to make it fit for our application was a big part of this project and I was even a little bit proud when we presented the final result.

3. Serious gaming
Two electives I followed were focussed on serious gaming. On the one hand I appreciate the design part of a game, while on the other hand I'm very focussed on the details for the final result. I want everything to look and feel good and I feel really responsible to make the final game something fun and worth playing. 

I was part of a group that created a analog game that shows te players the challenges that come with making a transition from a linear economy to a circular economy. This was a board game with 5 players, 3 product manufacturers and 2 waste managers. All players have to work together to make the transition and manage their resources. In this group I was mainly responsible for the artwork and graphics of the boardgame. In both testing sessions with other students and our client, CE Delft, we saw engaged players, fully concetrated on making the transition and winning the game. Our client was very happy with our game and will use this in the future within meetings with municipalities and policy makers. This feels like a great achievement.

As continuation of this course I followed a course on making a digital serious game. The goal of the game was to bridge the gap between two generations, grandparents and their grandchildren. Both generations can learn from each other, the grandparents have accumulated experience and knowledge in their lives, but have little experience with, relatively new, techonological developments and devices. Children are very keen to play with these technological devices and operating them is like a second nature. We wanted to create a win-win situation in which both parties learn from each other. 

The multiplayer game we designed has two players, a child on a bike and a grandparent with a touch device. The child rides a bike on a track which has holes in it. The child's cycling will be translated into speed in the game, while at some places, 'stages', in the game the grandparent still has to draw the track. The child has to anticipate their speed while also acting according to traffic situations, such as a pedestrian crossing or red light. The grandparent learns to interact with touch gestures and can ask the child for help if necessary. Additionally, if the child refuses to stop for red lights or crossing, the grandparent is notified and can teach (in real life) the child something about that specific situation. The game is live and playable <a href src="http://duorider.letsinspire.com" target="_blank">here</a>
